                <p>Every person with a conscience is against child abuse. But for the first time in decades, policymakers are giving the most widely used intervention in child abuse cases — mandatory reporting — a second look. 

                In Colorado, a task force born of calls to strengthen mandatory reporting laws after a horrific abuse case has grown into something different: a look at whether these laws do what they are intended to do at all. 

                “The way our mandatory reporting system exists right now — my opinion is that it does more harm than it does good,” Jerry Milner told the state’s Mandatory Reporting Task Force last  month. </p>

                        <p>Milner is former head of the Children’s Bureau, a federal agency tasked with child abuse prevention. He said listening to families, including children, who have been negatively impacted by intrusive and damaging investigations by child protective services changed his mind about a policy he once endorsed. 

                        “There are things that warrant that intrusion, but it’s not the most typical situation, and the trauma that we inflict on families has given me quite a different perspective,” he said. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> The Colorado task force is only the second one in the nation, after Massachusetts, to look closely at reforming laws that have long enjoyed broad bipartisan political support and met little organized resistance. It convenes at a time of national debate over family policing practices that harm vast numbers of children and parents of color, in particular, while repeatedly failing to help children who are most at risk of abuse. 

                        In Colorado, mandatory reporters — those required under the law to report their suspicions of child abuse or neglect — include doctors, teachers, social workers and therapists and dozens of other professions. While anyone can call the state’s child abuse hotline, 73% of reports last year came from people identifying themselves as mandatory reporters, according to data provided by the Colorado Department of Human Services.

                        Colorado’s effort at reform arose from pressure to fill gaps in the state’s mandatory reporting system after the death of 7-year-old Olivia Gant in 2017. Gant’s mother, Kelly Turner, is serving a 16-year-sentence for the child’s death. Prosecutors said she faked her child’s illness, subjecting her to years of painful and unnecessary surgeries, procedures and medications. An investigation by The Denver Post revealed that some staff at Children’s Hospital Colorado had suspicions that the child was being abused, but that they had reported them to the hospital rather than law enforcement, child protection agencies or the state child abuse and neglect hotline. The hospital never passed along their concerns. 

                        In response to the case, Child Protection Ombudsman Stephanie Villafuerte issued a report in September 2021 recommending that state legislators clarify mandatory reporting laws — including by defining what it meant to require an “immediate” report, attaching training requirements to mandatory reporters, and specifying who is responsible for reporting suspicions in institutional settings like hospitals. 

                        The recommendations seemed unlikely to encounter much resistance. Mandatory reporting laws around the country have reliably expanded from year to year since the 1960s, especially after high-profile abuse cases.

                        Not this time. 

                        “We quickly learned that the bill would not be just a straight implementation of the recommendations in the report,” said Democratic state Rep. Meg Froelich, at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in March 2022 for a bill intended to address the ombudsman’s concerns. “And that is why the bill makes a few agreed-upon changes and then charges a task force with looking at the many, many, maybe surprising points of contention.”

                        Even those “agreed-upon changes” fell apart. 

                        The objections came from some unlikely places. It wasn’t just emergency room doctors, griping that they’d have to leave their patients’ sides to file a time-consuming report. Or first responders, who wanted to be able to designate somebody to make reports, rather than require it of every single person who became aware of a particular case of suspected abuse or neglect.
